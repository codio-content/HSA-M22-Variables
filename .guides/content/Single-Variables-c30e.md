A variable is a named container.  The actual value is stored in the computer's memory and the name we give the variable allows us to access that location in the computer's memory.

Variables can have different types of data.
- Common variable types include:
- Integers (any number without a decimal)
- Float (numbers with decimals)
- Binary (true or false)
- Characters (single letters)
- Strings (Whole words or sentences)

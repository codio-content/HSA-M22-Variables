A list can contain multiple values but the list only has one name.  As a result, there are many values within the one variable name.  How do we know which value to address?

Lists may use the same name for many values but they have an additional index value or location within the list.

Imagine all of the houses on your street.  They all have the same street name but they are separated by the number on the house.

The benefit of a list over multiple, separate variables is that we can use another variable for the spot or index in the list.  In this way, multiple variables can be visited in an automated way.
